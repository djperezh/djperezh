<p>
With 15 years of experience as a Software Engineer (in Travel, Insurance, Retail and Tech industry), I enjoy approaching problems with analytical thinking in order to design, propose and implement creative solutions, always with attention to detail and considering the scalability aspect.
Recent experience delivering reliable products for e-Commerce and SaaS through Cloud Architecture solutions.
Apart from Technology, and as an enthusiast of Diversity initiatives, I love to help and volunteer for my community and I also enjoy playing sports and music.
